# GO-Fetch-AndroidApp
Repository for my personal project based on API for 'Pokemon Go' named GO Fetch.

This Project makes use of multiple open to use APIs available to provide an interface to users that displayed all the general Game data about the mobile game 'Pokemon GO'. Users can also sort/filter/arrange the available data as per their needs.

This is still a work in progress, future/intended features include:
-Display all relevant data about all the moves in a seperate screen (Move Dex).
-Display Known ditto forms in the game (Ditto Dex).
-Type Interaction Chart (Type Dex).
-Add/Remove Favorite Pokemon.
-User Login system.
